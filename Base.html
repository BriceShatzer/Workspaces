All suppliers are encouraged to exceed the standard, each with their own blend of performance and innovation. This standard establishes a baseline set of standard formats for media intended for use in digital signage applications. The baseline consists of support for all the formats listed as ®standardå profiles.

Although popular wisdom suggests that \"any publicity is good publicity,à prior research has demonstrated only downsides to negative press. Negative reviews or word-of-mouth, for example, have been found to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a combination of econometric analysis and experimental methods, the authors unify these perspectives to delineate contexts under which negative publicity about a product will have positive versus negative effects. Specifically, they argue that negative publicity can increase purchase likelihood and sales by increasing product awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should have differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three studies support this perspective. While a negative review in the New York Times hurt sales of books by well-known authors, for example, it increased sales of books that had lower prior awareness. The studies further underscore the importance of a gap between publicity and purchase occasion and the mediating role of increased awareness in these effects.","dlversion": "2009","postDate": "0000-00-00 00:00:00","hits": 195,"user": "pgrima@popai.com","members": 1,"mirrors": ""}, {"id": 75,"title": "White Paper: Precision, Prudence, and Passion","filename": "http://www.popai.com/store/downloads/WhitePaper-Precision-Passion-Prudence-2009.pdf","file_description": "Letås dispel the misnomer that shopper marketing is just in-store marketing.

The report, titled Shopper Influence Study, found that when it comes to influencing purchases, nearly two-thirds of accompanied shoppers claimed that the people they were shopping with had little to no influence on their purchase decisions. Coupled with the finding that those accompanied shoppers who recalled or interacted with in-store marketing materials realized a 69 percent higher mean in spending highlights the impact that in-store marketing programs have upon the shopper.

Among those key findings are: Shopperså goals are the same when coming to the store yet those who shop with others may take one extra step to prepare Ñ the written shopping list. In-store shopping expectations are created equal.

Further,critical to Shopper Marketing is strategic integration with retailers and their marketing agendas to create relevant programs for their shoppers. However, before retail integration becomes a focus, brands must better understand their consumer/shopper relationship. By more clearly defining the difference between consumers and shoppers, the imperative role of Shopper Marketing in brand communication begins to take shape.

The authors propose that the most promising theoretical mechanism for shopping momentum comes from Gollwitzerås (1990) theory of implementation and deliberation mind-sets. Under this theory, shopping momentum occurs because the initial purchase moves the consumer from a deliberative to an implemental mind-set, thus driving subsequent purchases. After demonstrating the main shopping momentum effect, the authors support the mind-set theory by (1) demonstrating how an initial purchase induces implemental orientation and (2) by illustrating that an implementation mind-set leads to greater purchase. The authors then explore the boundaries of this effect by demonstrating how shopping momentum can be interrupted.

We decompose sales volume into conversionrate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of salesvolume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find thatstore sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impactof traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasingaverage traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $9.97. Further, we find thatthe marginal returns to traffic increases from $10.00 to $11.32 when labor increases by one standard deviation.In addition, we find that the conversion rate declines with increasing traffic and a lower conversion rate isassociated with a decrease in future traffic growth.
